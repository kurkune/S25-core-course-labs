## Best Practices in the Web Application

This Flask-based web application follows several best practices to ensure maintainability, security, and performance:

### 1. Code Structure and Maintainability
- The application follows the **Flask MVC pattern**, separating business logic from presentation.
- The `render_template` function is used to keep HTML templates separate from Python logic.
- The code is formatted according to **PEP 8** standards for readability and consistency.

### 2. Timezone Handling
- The application retrieves UTC time and manually adjusts it to **Moscow Time (UTC+3)**.
- The `datetime` module is used with `timezone.utc` to ensure accurate and timezone-aware conversions.

### 3. Coding Standards and Style
- The application uses meaningful function names (`index`) to maintain readability.
- Constants like the UTC offset (`timedelta(hours=3)`) are clearly defined and used appropriately.
- The `if __name__ == '__main__':` guard ensures that the application runs only when executed directly, avoiding conflicts in imported modules.

### 4. Testing Implementation
- Unit tests should be implemented using **pytest** or Flask’s built-in testing tools.
- Edge cases, such as invalid timezone handling, should be covered in test cases.
- Template rendering can be tested using Flask’s `test_client` to ensure correct output.

### 5. Code Quality Assurance
- **Static analysis tools** such as `flake8` and `black` can be used to enforce coding standards.
- Logging should be added in production environments to track errors and application behavior.
- Dependency management should be handled using `requirements.txt` to ensure consistent installations.

### 6. Security Considerations
- Debug mode (`debug=True`) should be disabled in production to prevent exposing sensitive information.
- Input sanitization and validation should be implemented where necessary to prevent security vulnerabilities.
- The application should be deployed with **WSGI servers** like Gunicorn for better scalability and performance.
