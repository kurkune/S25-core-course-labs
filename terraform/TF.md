## Best Practises

- Version Control: Store Terraform configurations in Git to track changes and collaborate.
- Modularization: Use reusable modules to simplify maintenance and reduce duplication.
- State Management: Store state files remotely for collaboration and integrity.
- Provider Versions: Lock provider versions to prevent unexpected updates.
- Environment Separation: Maintain separate environments (dev, staging, prod) using variables.
- Immutable Infrastructure: Recreate resources instead of modifying them to avoid drift.
- Variable Management: Use input variables for flexibility across environments.
- Sensitive Data Handling: Store credentials securely using environment variables or secrets management.
- Monitoring & Logging: Track changes and troubleshoot efficiently with monitoring tools.
- Testing: Use automated testing (e.g., Terratest) to catch errors early.
